# Why memory is important in Java:

## How memory works in Java:

Java virtual machine is incredibly complicated and as Java developer we donâ€™t need to understand exactly how it operates.

### The Stack

1. Every thread has its own stack.
2. Managed effectively by JVM.
3. Java knows exactly when data on stack can be destroyed.

### The Heap

1. Heap is used to store data that has longer lifetime than a single code block. Ex - Objects that needs to be shared across multiple methods.
2. Heap memory - All of the memory of your application except for the data on the stacks.
3. In an application there is one heap which is shared across all the threads and a number of stacks one for each thread.
4. All the threads, and in fact all code blocks in our application can potentially access the heap.
5. In Java all objects are stored on heap.
   > Note: In Java all objects are stored on the heap.

Example:

Variables are a reference to the object ( stored on stack )
Local variables are stored on the stack ( Primitive variables are entirely local ).

> Note: In java there is no way we can directly interact with heap memory.

Example 2 for better understanding:
**Code**

```
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Memory {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        List<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>();
        myList.add("one");
        myList.add("two");
        myList.add("three");
        printList(myList);

    }

    public static void printList(List<String> data) {
        String value = data.get(1);
        data.add("four");
        System.out.println(value);
    }

}

```

Explanation:

1. By creating myList object some memory is allocated in heap area and it is being reference through myList variable inside stack ( through which program execution will access the object).
2. Adding string again created string object inside heap area and it's reference is mentioned in the list object inside heap area. Note that there is no way we can directly access the string. We have to follow the link through myList stack variable.
3. In the printList method in the first line **value** variable will now store a direct reference to string **two**.
4. data is a local stack variable for printList method which can access List object area inside heap. Using this reference we are adding a new string **four**.
5. While printing value it will print two.
